    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Tofu can be made of any lgeume (bean). When we make our own tofu, we get the opportunity to try different flavors and textures. This split green pea based tofu makes a tofu with a snap to the bite and a bright vegetal flavor that pairs incredibly well with the bright, bold flavors of this Soy Chili crisp sauce.

        To make this recipe ou will be soaking, blending, sieving, and cooking split green peas into a bright green tofu. You will be throwing together a quick sauce that packs a lot of punch. Let's go!
