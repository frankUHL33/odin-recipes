            <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        If one is going to eat a vegan or plant-based diet, one is going to need to be intentional about certain necessary nutrients that are typically entering our diets via animal products. This recipe tackles our need for B vitamins.

        Plant-based is an incomplete term, without fungi (which are NOT plants) we would not be able to get B or D Vitamins from a vegan diet. Green Goddess Dressing is an effective way of getting our B Vitamins et by making a dressing that is dense with nutrional yeast. We also get our iodine using iodizzed salt
