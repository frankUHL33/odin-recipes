        <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Tomato Nigiri is a fascinating recipe that has an appearance like Tuna Nigiri. We will be taking advantage of all the glumates present in Tomatoes and the magic of marinade to create a surprisingly savory and tender piece of sushi.

        You don't have to forgoe sushi just because you are inflicted with the desire to eat plant based. Whether for health, environmentalism, sympathy for animals, clout in progressive spaces, or a wondrous combination of these reasons, eating vegan can be culinarily satisfying.</p>
